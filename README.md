# Coursera-Duke-University-JAVA

**This is the Code for Duke University Java class on Coursera**
The First Week and the First Assignment of Week 2 I use BlueJ. From the Second Assignment of Week 2 I started to use IDEA from jetBrain. So the test method and the languages should be a little different since the changement of the IDE.
