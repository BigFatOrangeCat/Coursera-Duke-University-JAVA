# Coursera-Duke-University-JAVA

**This is the Code for Duke University Java class on Coursera**

*The First Week and the First Assignment of Week 2 I use BlueJ.* 

*From the Second Assignment of Week 2 I started to use IDEA from jetBrain. *

*From the Week3 I turned to Eclipse and I use JEE Maven and Junit to bulid my system.*

*So the test method and the languages should be a little different since the changement of the IDE.*
